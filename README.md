# The Mystery Machine

MVP:
	We plan to make a First-Person Shooter in the Unity Engine where the primary feature is that player to takes control of the last enemy he shot. The player will utilize common firearms against enemies programed with unique AI. 

Additions:

	-Larger variety of weapons.
	
	-Larger variety of enemies.

	-Greater number of levels, both larger and more complicated.

	-Custom models for weaponry, characters.

	-Story elements.

User Story:

 As the user I am looking to be entertained. The game I play should be somewhat challenging yet not overwhelming. All mechanics
 should be easy to understand. Menus should be unobtrusive. Ultimately the game should be fun to play.
