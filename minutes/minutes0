Summary:
We discussed what will be required for the prototype submission, the version of Unity we'll be using, 
and how the minutes will be coordinated. We talked about how we will implement the HUD and the damage that the enemies will
take vs the players. We talked about putting in a health system. Discussed how enemies will damage the player and our main menu.
