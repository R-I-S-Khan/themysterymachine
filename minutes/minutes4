Summary: 
We discussed using a character creator for Unity called Mixamo. We talked about the level we would create for the
alpha release and the deployment method. We fixed a few bugs including an issue with the pause feature of the game
and the game time. We talked about if we would seperate enemy and player health into two classes or would we
abstract one class for both. We updated the new build that fixes the bug. We talked about submitting the new video
and what it would include.
