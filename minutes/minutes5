Summary: 
We discussed what we need done for this week. We discussed that we need to improve on enemy AI. We discussed 
how we would have the enemies look. We discussed where we would place more weapon drops. We talked about setting 
up enemy field of view and movement of enemies. We need to set up a fall damage and enemy shooting. We talked 
about player physics and jumping issues in certain parts of the game. We need to be able to get ammo capacity 
and get weapon being used from enemy shooting script to work with swapping mechanics. We talked about the need
for a game over script for when the player dies. We talked about the need for another level. We discussed whether
we wanted music or not.
