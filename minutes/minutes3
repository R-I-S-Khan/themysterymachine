Summary: 
We discussed what we needed for the alpha release. We talked about how we could upload the game to an existing website
for release. We talked about issues for the prefab and the need for having a completed level for release. We discussed issues
with the raycast shooting from the person instead of the gun. We uploaded a new version of the build that fixed some minor issues. 
We discussed having to fix the reload glitch. We talk about creating a bugs list. We talked about the player not yet having 
fall damage and how that works with the rooftop level. 

List explicitly and in detail what each individual team member accomplished since the last meeting:
Nate - Added the ability to change weapons, reload, and a spread on the bullets.
Timothy - put in a basic swapping mechanic for when the player "kills" another enemy. 
Ron - Worked a little bit on implementing the enemy movement and learned about Game A.I in general.

List explicitly and in detail what each individual team member will accomplish before the next meeting. 
Nate Bud - will improve the swapping mechanic so you get the gun of the enemy you just shot. 

Timothy Wu - will make a rooftop map. 

Ron Davis - Will reupload the HUD so it is fully functional with the health system and ammo count.
Will work on completing enemy movement.
